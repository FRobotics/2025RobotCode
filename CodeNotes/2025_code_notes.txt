2025 Robot Control System Code Notes:


========
CLIMB
========
-general-
	- I didn't see a VI to issue a Cancel command.
Begin
	- The motor will need to have a current limit defined.
	- If there is a position sensor, it will be a REV ThroughBore encoder
		wired to the RoboRIO.  It will be a Counter configured in
		semi-period mode connected to a DIO port.  The scaling is as
		follows 1us = 0 degrees, 1024us = 360 degrees.
StateMachine
	- For ClimbRest make this three different values.  if > 50 make it -x, 
		if < 40 make it +x, otherwise make it 0 and decide it is done.
		This is known as hysterisis.  
		The value will NEVER be exactly 45.
	- Likely when going to rest there nothing is being lifted.  Use a much
		smaller value than -1 and +1 (say +/- 0.2)
	- ClimbReach will not likely have a load.  As such a much smaller motor
		output would be okay (say 0.2).
ExecuteLogic
	- comment in code which direction is FWD and REV for limit switches!!
	- Use The buildarray vi to create the command array.  Don't create a
		cluster then convert it to an array.
	- The Climb INC commands are NOT protected by the limit switches.  
		Each of these commands needs to be ANDed with the NOT of the 
		limit switch for that particular direction.
	- Is the CLAMP really needed.  Where in the code is it possible to be
		different than +/- 1.0
	- Do NOT read sensors in the ExecuteLogic function.  These sensors need
		to be inputs to this VI, so it can be simulated.  Read the
		sensors in the Execute VI and pass them to the ExecuteLogic VI.
	- Remove the commented out code at the bottom right that isn't used.
	- The SensorPosition input is written the a global variable with what 
		appears to be the wrong name.
Execute
	- Read the limit switches here, not in ExecuteLogic.  Pass the values
		as parameters to ExecuteLogic.
	- If there is a sensor position it won't be from the SparkMax motor
		controller.  It would be a REV ThroughBoreEncoder wired to
		to the RoboRIO and read as a Counter in SemiPeriodMode.
Teleop
	- All the commands except for IncReach and IncPull need to have EdgeOn vi
		between the input control and case structure so that this command
		only gets sent once when the button is pressed.
	- This VI needs to be able to issue a Cancel command.
Global
	- looks good
Network
	- looks good
ClimbStates.ctl
	- Give the ENUM an real name.
	- Make it a strict type def


========
WRIST
========
- general -
	- Don't really need 2 different global VI.  One VI can contain all the
		global variables for this system.  However it doesn't hurt anything
		to do it this way.
Begin
	- Don't use 0 for the seconds from neutral to full.  (maybe 0.2 seconds)
	- Set a non-zero can id.
	- The wrist won't be using the motor's built in encoder.  It will have
		a REV ThroughBore Encoder wired to the roboRIO.  So don't need
		the position conversion functions.  It also probably won't have
		limit switches.
ExecuteLogic
	- inputs and outputs look good.
	- needs work -- won't offer additional comments yet.
Execute
	- needs work.  This will be fairly simple.  Read sensors, call execute logic,
		output actuator (motor) demands.
StartPosition
	- Think about the name.  This might be DesiredPosition??



==========
INTAKE
==========
note: I didn't get a chance to review the newest version yet.




==========
Elevator
==========
note: I didn't get a chance to review the newest version yet.

ExecuteLogic.VI
	- Setpoint - Is always zero.  It never changes.
	- Need to set limits -- They currently are -15 and 120.   Suggest 8 and 41.
	- There is an extra -- appears to be unused -- position control logic at 
		the bottom of the VI.  (Suggest removing..)
	- The logic still has the arm gravity compensation.  Suggest removing.
		(Compensation for the elevator will be different.)
Teleop
	- Doesn't have a Cancel button.  (To stop elevator where it is.)

======
Drive
======
	- Need to use Phoenix 6 VI for CanCoder
	- Need to update for Spark Max VI

==========
New Auto
==========
AutoListProcessor
	- ElevRestWait - VI is named Auto Arm Wait...  Should be Elevator...

==========
Vision
==========
- general -
	- Need to get from Barcie
	- Add cameras 3,4

==========
Trajectory
==========
- general -
	- Need to get from Barcie

==========
LED
==========
- general -
	- Need to define meanings and do code.

==========
Dashboard
==========
- general -
	- Need to do.
